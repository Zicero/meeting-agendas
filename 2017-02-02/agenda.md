## The Basics of Unix File Permissions
- All files have an owner and a group
- 10 bits dictate the permissions for everyone on the system
- The 10 bits are separated into 4 blocks (1 3 3 3)
- For more information, see [here](https://www.linux.com/learn/understanding-linux-file-permissions)
- To see permissions of a file:
```
ls -l
```
- To change the owner of a file:
```
sudo chown <user> <file>
```
- To change the group of a file:
```
sudo chgrp <group> <file>
```
- These commands can be used recursively
